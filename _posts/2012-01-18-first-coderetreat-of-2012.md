title: First coderetreat of 2012
preview: On Saturday 7 January Adi and I facilitated the first coderetreat of 2012 in Amsterdam and it was a blast. It was my first coderetreat outside of Belgium and it was fun to see that people were really surprised that a guy living in France and one living in Belgium were crazy enough to drive all the way to Amsterdam to go and facilitate a coderetreat there. All I can say is that I'm glad I can do things like this. It's awesome to see passionate people that really want to change things. It's an honor to be able to meet all those people and discussing with them.
