### Ask the attendees what they want

During the Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 (GDCR) I facilitated the event in Turku, Helsinki. That is when I presented the toughest constraint ever in any coderetreats I facilitated until now.

Since I have a lot of constraints in the list, some time ago I started to ask the attendees how difficult would they want the constraints to be. I am asking them on scale from 1 to 5, 1 being boring, and 5 being extremely difficult, what would they want to do as difficulty.

Another thing I'm doing, stealing the idea from [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexboly), is to ask the attendees of the coderetreat about the expectations they have. They write one expectation on a sticky note and we look at them and they choose what they want to practice. I tell them about constraints that will generate the kind of learning they want.

Usually during coderetreats the attendees want constraints of the difficulty between 2 and 3\. Probably because 1 seems boring and 5 seems scary.

### The constraint

Now it was different. They wanted the scary constraints. And they insisted. So here is the constraint.
