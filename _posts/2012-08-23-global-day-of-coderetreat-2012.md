**A Day Like No Other, Global Day of Coderetreat**

Wow! Last year, on December 3rd, 2011, over 1800 developers in 94 cities through 14 time zones dedicated the day to practicing their craft. This was Global Day of Coderetreat 2011. Video calls criss-crossed the globe, as groups linked to say hello to other cities, welcoming each other to an amazing day spent working on improving their fundamental development skills. I had the honor of facilitating 2 events on that day, kicking the day off in Sydney, Australia, then jumping across the International Date Line, going back in time, to close the day by facilitating the last event in Honolulu, Hawaii. Since Global Day of Coderetreat 2011, we have seen the number of events grow to the point where it is rare to find a weekend without at least 2 workshops happening somewhere in the world. Check out the [map of cities from last year](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004b0b076e7ed3148f35&msa=0&ll=13.007757,146.540268&spn=150.880909,12.304688).

Also on that day, we announced a new community network at [coderetreat.org](http://www.coderetreat.org) and the beginning of a non-profit foundation to support practice-oriented events and help fund activities to encourage kids to learn to program called the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f).

Based on the enormous success of last year, we are doing it again in 2012! On December 8, 2012, developers world-wide will once again sit down and share a day like no other, creating a network across the globe of people caring about getting better at a core aspect of what we do: writing maintainable software.

Of course, at its heart, coderetreat is a local event, organized and facilitated by volunteers, and we had a wonderful group of people step up to host last year. This year is no different, and we are looking forward to working with old and new hosts and facilitators around the world. We are putting together a great global organizing group to help coordinate the world, including [Jim Hurne](https://twitter.com/jthurne), [Adrian Bolboaca](https://twitter.com/adibolb), [Erik Talboom](https://twitter.com/talboomerik) and [Alissa Conaty](https://twitter.com/volunteerjunkie).

Simply put, last year was awesome, and this year is going to be even more amazing. GDCR11 started with a blog post putting out the idea of getting maybe 20 cities together on a single day to do a coderetreat, and ended with [94 cities in 14 time zones](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004b0b076e7ed3148f35&msa=0&ll=13.007757,146.540268&spn=150.880909,12.304688). This year, for GDCR12, let's step it up a notch. My goal for this year is 200 cities. Yup, 200! With an average of 15-20 developers at each event, this will mean we have 3000-4000 developers around the world sharing in this amazing day. Can we do it? Of course we can.

Over the next couple weeks, we'll be putting out a lot more information about taking part in Global Day of Coderetreat 2012 (GDCR12). So stay tuned by following [@coderetreat](https://twitter.com/coderetreat) and the [#gdcr12 hashtag](https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23gdcr12). We're already seeing events starting to be registered on the [GDCR12 event page](http://coderetreat.org/events/event/listByDate?date=2012-12-8).  As they get added to the event page, I'm putting them on [the map of registered GDCR 2012 cities](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004c84674c62aa900e06&msa=0).

And, yes, I plan on doing the Sydney-Honolulu crazy time-traveling activity again.

**That's cool, but you know what is really cool?**

200 cities is a cool goal, but you know what would be really cool? A short video call with someone on the International Space Station. Do you think you can help us do this? If so, please contact me at [coreyhaines@gmail.com](mailto:coreyhaines+gdcr12@gmail.com).

**Want to host an event in your city for Global Day of Coderetreat 2012?**

Hosting a participating event is pretty straightforward. You'll need to secure a location, get enough local sponsorship for lunch (and possibly morning coffee, if possible, since we do start early), and find a facilitator for the day. We're working on a sponsorship prospectus that you can use to help explain the day to possible sponsors in your area.

If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat event in your city for GDCR12, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGpyc2wzT1pNeFhKcmlaOE94bGJlc3c6MQ#gid=0). I will add you to the organizers mailing list where you can share and get help from other hosts around the world.

**Want to become a local or global sponsor of Global Day of Coderetreat 2012?**

Email me at [coreyhaines@gmail.com](mailto:coreyhaines+gdcr12@gmail.com), and I'll give you more information about the options. We'll be preparing more information about sponsorship levels, but a global sponsorship secures your place in front of a project 3000-4000 developers world-wide. Show your support for developers around the world with a global sponsorship. We'll have some administrative costs (stickers, travel, organizational costs), but extra sponsorship goes into the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund, a non-profit focused on supporting the goal of teaching kids to program.
