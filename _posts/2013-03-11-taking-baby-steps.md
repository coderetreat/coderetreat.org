I wrote a post on the history of _Taking Baby Steps_, you can read it [here](http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2013/01/the-history-of-taking-baby-steps/).

Now I would like to tell you more about the workshop and the technique itself. While coding, for me it is very important to be focused on one idea. Why? Because this is how _programmer mistakes_ appear in the code; some people tell them _bugs_. The other thing I am interested in is to have an undo button for every change. This is why I want to commit every 1-2 minutes.

The rules are the following:

> #### Steps
>
> 1.  Setup source control repository.
>
> 2.  Setup a timer for 2 minutes interval when you start.
>
> 3.  Write exactly one test
>
>     1.  If the **timer rings** and the **test is red** then **revert** and **start over**.
>
>     2.  If the **test is green** before timer rings then **commit**.
>
> 4.  Restart timer (no discussions in between timers)
>
> 5.  Refactor
>
>     1.  If the **timer rings** and the **refactoring is not complete** then **revert** and **start over**.
>
>     2.  If the **refactoring is complete** before the timer rings then **commit**.
>
> 6.  Restart the timer (no discussions in between timers)
>
> 7.  Go to 3.
>
> 8.  When session time is up **delete the code**.
