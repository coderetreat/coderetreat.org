I attended the [**Global Coderetreat**](http://coderetreat.org/) event initialized by [Corey Haines](http://coreyhaines.com/ "Corey Haines"). The general purpose of this event was to get a bunch of hackers together to implement [Conway’s Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Conway's Game of Life").

## Setting up goals

As **J. B. Rainsberger** mentioned in his article about [four elements of simple design](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design), it is best to setup goals for your retreat to get most out of it. Here is a list of what I achieved in every section:

1.  Being a mentor of TDD: I taught [dedan](https://github.com/dedan) how to use TDD, why  
    TDD helps you to think about your design
2.  Being a mentor of BDD: Showing a fellow Rubyist how to do BDD
3.  Doing something completely stupid: I played _evil coder_ and _ping-pong pairing_ with  
    [@tilosoenke](http://twitter.com/tilosoenke) - we couldn’t communicate with  
    words, only with code, one writing tests and other the implementation of the tests.
4.  Discuss about names: We said together and discussed about right names for methods, variables, and  
    classes. We concluded that good names saves you scary comments in your code
5.  Explain Ruby to a Java-Programmer
6.  Being mentored about Lisp: We solved the whole ‘Game of Live’ in common [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29), while  
    [@HansHuebener](http://twitter.com/hanshuebner) explained me the  
    strength and beauty in common Lisp, while the programmer explained me the strength and beauty of  
    Lisp.

## Conclusion

It was great to get so many people with so many different skills and mindsets together, exchange  
experience and encouraging others to try something new. I will definitely have a closer look on  
Lisp to enhance my Ruby style.
