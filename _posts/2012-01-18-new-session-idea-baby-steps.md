title: New session idea Baby steps
preview: Adi and I came up with a new idea that helps people to focus on small steps and also opens them up for committing small chunks very often. The main idea is that people get a very short time box to write a new test and implement it the simplest way possible. After that they get another short time box to refactor the code.
