Last Saturday I hosted and facilitated [Global Day Of Coderetreat event in Skopje (Macedonia)](http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2012-skopje-macedonia "Global Day Of Coderetreat event in Skopje (Macedonia)"). It is second year I'm doing that, you can read the notes from last year here [GDCR 2011](http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/31-global-day-of-coderetreat-in-skopje-macedonia "Global Day of Coderetreat 2011 Skopje (Macedonia)").

At GDCR 2012 we had 10 participants at out event that were challenged to work outside of their comfort zone and learn new things. They had a great time pair programming with their fellow developers, practicing TDD and writing code that respects the [4 rules of simple design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules "4 rules of simple design"). They worked in few different languages like: Ruby, Python, Javascript, Coffeescript and C. Here are some [photos](http://coderetreat.org/photo/albums/global-day-of-coderetreat-2012-skopje-macedonia "Photos from Global Day Of Coderetreat 2012 - Skopje (Macedonia)") from the event.

I would like to thank all [participants](http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2012-skopje-macedonia "GDRC 2012 Skopje (Macedonia) participants") for attending the event, companies: [Siyelo](http://siyelo.com/ "Siyelo"), [Ever Near](http://www.ever-near.com/ "Ever Near") and [NOVP](http://www.novp.com/ "NOVP") for sponsoring lunch, T-shirts and hardware for [Hacklab KIKA](http://b10g.spodeli.org/ "Hacklab KIKA Blog") where the event was organized.

Also I would like to thank [Corey Haines](https://twitter.com/coreyhaines "Corey Haines"), [Jim Hurne](https://twitter.com/jthurne "Jim Hurne") and [Adrian Bolboaca](http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/ "Adrian Bolboaca") for global organization and facilitator sessions, and special thanks to [Milan Nasevic](http://twitter.com/mnasevic "Milan Nasevic") and [Naum Kostovski](https://twitter.com/NaumKostovski "Naum Kostovski") for their help organize the event.

Coderetreat has been a great experience for me because even as a facilitator I've learned a lot about software design, OO principles and I'm looking forward to Global Day of Coderetreat 2013!
