title: Kudos for the Global Day of Coderetreat
preview: As last year I helped the coderetreat first-time facilitators to jump-in and organize their first coderetreat. I had some training sessions on Google Hangout during which I talked with a lot of passionate professionals from all over the world. Together with me Jim Hurne had done the same effort to spread his knowledge about the way he facilitates a coderetreat.

As last year I helped the coderetreat first-time facilitators to jump-in and organize their first coderetreat. I had some training sessions on Google Hangout during which I talked with a lot of passionate professionals from all over the world. Together with me [Jim Hurne](https://twitter.com/jthurne) had done the same effort to spread his knowledge about the way he facilitates a coderetreat.

Jim has done a lot of work for the Global Day, he added the sessions on the [coderetreat.org](http://coderetreat.org) website created, the hangouts for all the registered attendees for each session, and a lot of other very useful things. He was full of energy and I want to thank him for all that effort, I don’t think the Global Day would have been that successful without his sustained effort.

I chose to go to Cluj-Napoca to facilitate the coderetreat on the Global Day. I had talked with the [Cloud Troopers](http://cloudtroopers.ro/) company about hosting a community event, and this was the time. They were kind enough to sponsor also the lunch. Out host was [Georgiana Gligor](https://twitter.com/gbtekkie), and she was very keen to see what a coderetreat is all about.
