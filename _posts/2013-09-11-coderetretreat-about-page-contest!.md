title: Coderetretreat About Page Contest!
preview: Have you ever visited the coderetreat about page on coderetreat.org? If you have, then you know it is..umm..not enticing.  Oh sure, it describes what a coderetreat is, but it is not a very exciting description and the page does not give a good sense of what it is like to participate in a coderetreat.

Have you ever visited the [coderetreat about page](http://coderetreat.org/about) on [coderetreat.org](http://coderetreat.org)? If you have, then you know it is..umm..not enticing.  Oh sure, it describes what a coderetreat is, but it is not a very exciting description and the page does not give a good sense of what it is like to participate in a coderetreat.

What if we had a single page anyone could visit that would not only describe what a coderetreat is, but made each visitor crave to attend, host, or sponsor a coderetreat?

How about you create one?

Come up with the best Coderetreat About page and not only will we use your page on coderetreat.org, but we will also give you two ebooks (compliments of [Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/) and [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com)[](http://oreilly.com/)).

So get ready, be inspired, and create the best Coderetreat About page you can dream up! Tell the coderetreat story and convince developers to attend, volunteers to host, and companies to sponsor. Use pictures or video or fancy shapes. Make an impact!

When your page is ready, [submit it](http://coderetreat.org/about-page-contest/entry-form) by September 30th and the GDCR Global Coordinators will review your page. The winning page will be announced on October 2nd.

Not into web design? Do not worry! This is the first of three contests we are holding leading up to the [Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 (GDCR13)](http://gdcr.coderetreat.org).  If you are a videophile, then you’ll like the Delete Your Code! Video Contest. We are also going to hold a Global Day of Coderetreat T-Shirt Contest. More details coming soon.

In the meantime...may the best page win!
