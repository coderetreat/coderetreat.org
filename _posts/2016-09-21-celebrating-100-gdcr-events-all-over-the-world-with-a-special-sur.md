<p>Hey everyone, we're celebrating the first hundred locations for the Global Day Of Coderetreat 2016 (psst, it's on Oct 22nd!) and we're really excited to reveal a little surprise we prepared for the community:</p>
<strong>Our new Logo!</strong>

<p>The Global Day of Coderetreat is an opportunity for developers to gather together and practice their craft. Our new logo represents four people joining a discussion circle. This expresses the value and camaraderie&nbsp;that comes from the exchange
of methods and ideas. (thanks&nbsp;<a href='https://twitter.com/mplavcan' target='_blank'>Matt</a>&nbsp;for that excellent explanation)</p>
<p>We'd like to thank <a href='http://smartviewapp.com/'>SmartView</a> for kindly sponsoring the Logo and <a href='https://twitter.com/abarylko'>Amir Barylko</a> who went through a lot of revisions with us :)</p>
<p>To the next one hundred locations!</p>
