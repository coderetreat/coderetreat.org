Hey everyone, we're celebrating the first hundred locations for the Global Day Of Coderetreat 2016 (psst, it's on Oct 22nd!) and we're really excited to reveal a little surprise we prepared for the community:

**Our new Logo!**

![Our new Logo](http://api.ning.com:80/files/jSNhDxbJzkhXrrY0iRpH6BcVvhI*gxlw8omnpCMeGIbJPEBP6nkR*bZZpyI5nntSQEqOUPH*Oq8w8q3GW00f01l37OPmLcLO/globaldayiso1.ai.png)


The Global Day of Coderetreat is an opportunity for developers to gather together and practice their craft. Our new logo represents four people joining a discussion circle. This expresses the value and camaraderie&nbsp;that comes from the exchange
of methods and ideas. (thanks&nbsp;<a href='https://twitter.com/mplavcan' target='_blank'>Matt</a>&nbsp;for that excellent explanation)

We'd like to thank [SmartView](http://smartviewapp.com/) for kindly sponsoring the Logo and [Amir Barylko](https://twitter.com/abarylko) who went through a lot of revisions with us :)

To the next one hundred locations!
