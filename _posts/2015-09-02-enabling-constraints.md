Reading a tweet by @mattbarcomb&nbsp;led me to this post: "[Enabling constraints are about opening possibilities by limiting choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20160322104242/http://dancingwithelephants.ca/tag/enabling-constraints/)". A short read.&nbsp;Coderetreat
  facilitators&nbsp;use this, and *have fun* doing it!


Also, "[Constraints that Enable Innovation](https://vimeo.com/128934608)" - Alicia Juarrero, Professor Emerita of Philosophy at Prince George’s Community College (MD) on "enabling" innovation.
  Overflowing with great stuff on the fundamentals of natural learning.


Notable quote:   
*"Take the system far from equilibrium. Nothing interesting ever happens at equilibrium."*


Texas version: *"There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos."* I'll leave the sourcing as an excise for the reader.
