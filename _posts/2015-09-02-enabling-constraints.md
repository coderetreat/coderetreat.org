Reading a tweet by @mattbarcomb led me to this post: "[Enabling constraints are about opening possibilities by limiting choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20160322104242/http://dancingwithelephants.ca/tag/enabling-constraints/)". A short read. Coderetreat facilitators use this, and _have fun_ doing it!

Also, "[Constraints that Enable Innovation"](https://vimeo.com/128934608) - Alicia Juarrero, Professor Emerita of Philosophy at Prince George’s Community College (MD) on "enabling" innovation. Overflowing with great stuff on the fundamentals of natural learning.

Notable quote:  
"Take the system far from equilibrium. Nothing interesting ever happens at equilibrium."

Texas version: "There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos." I'll leave the sourcing as an excise for the reader.
