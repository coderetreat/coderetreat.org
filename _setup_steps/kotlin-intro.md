*Kotlin* is a *JVM* (**J**ava **V**irtual **M**achine) language similar to **Java**, but with a less verbose syntax and a lot of modern features. It is a first-class programming language for **Android** and has great interoperability with other JVM-based languages like Java.

In this tutorial, we will set up a state-of-the-art kotlin project with *gradle*, a package management tool, and *kotlin.test*, the built-in testing interface. We will use *JetBrains IntelliJ Community Edition* for editing code. It is quite a powerhouse and offers a lot of features that make working with Kotlin very pleasant, not the least because JetBrains are the creators of both.

We will use *git* to make sure that we save a state of the project that you can return to after each session, starting on a blank slate and all.
