*Java* is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It powers every *Android* device, and a lot of companies use it to run their webservices with *Spring* (an extensive application framework).

In this tutorial, we will set up a state-of-the-art java project with *maven* (`mvn`), a package management tool, and *JUnit 5*, a popular testing library. We will use *JetBrains IntelliJ Community Edition* for editing code. It is quite a powerhouse and offers a lot of features that make working with Java very pleasant.
