There might be the chance to try another language at a Coderetreat. Which one depends on the audience, so you'll might get the opportunity to peek into *Elm*, but there might as well be someone at your event who's been working with *Perl*.

To make sure you're prepared for all weathers, we'll set you up with [`kata-bootstraps`](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps), a repository where volunteers accumulated several setups for a lot of different languages so you can get started quickly.

To clone it, open a terminal with Git (e.g. *Git Bash* on Windows) and navigate (`cd`) to your projects folder. In there, we'll clone the repository into a new folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps.git
```

If you're interested in any particular language right away, the folder for that language should come with a `README.md` that describes the necessary steps to start. The goal is as always to have a failing, and a passing test to make sure the project is setup correctly.
