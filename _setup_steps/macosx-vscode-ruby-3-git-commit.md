Now that we have the project in a good shape, it's time to add it to `git`. Open a new terminal and `cd` to the project folder. Run `git init .` to initialize a new repository in the folder we're developing our application in.

```shell
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/coderetreat/.git/
```

`git` has a handy command, `git status`, that will tell you the current state of your project. You can run this any time without any consequence, just to check what `git` thinks has changed.

Now `git add .` will add all files in the folder to the "stage". We can commit this stage to `git` by running `git commit -m "Add boilerplate with a failing testcase"`, where the string is the _commit message_ in which we describe what we changed.

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you just set up your project with a failing test-case and you're all set for the coderetreat!
