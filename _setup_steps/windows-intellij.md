We'll continue with installing _IntelliJ_, a free IDE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) with support for a lot of different languages. It has excellent suppport for Kotlin and other JVM-based languages languages.

Download the installer for Windows and proceed to install it as you would any other Windows Application. The default settings are fine as they are.
