_NodeJs_ is a runtime for executing _JavaScript_ on the server-side. It is the most popular runtime for using JavaScript on a server, and the basis for most frontend projects as well!

Node comes with `npm`, a package manager that allows you to conveniently install third-party packages, such as `jest` (a test-runner), or `express` (a webserver) or even frontend-specific JavaScript libraries like `VueJS` or `Angular`. Even _VisualStudio Code_, the code editor we'll use in this tutorial, is written using NodeJs!
