# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces around coderetreat.org. Local events are highly encouraged to adopt a Code of Conduct as well, but please note that this Code of Conduct does not apply to local events unless the local organizers explicitly say so.

Our Code of Conduct is taken from [https://communitycodeofconduct.com/](https://communitycodeofconduct.com/).

## The Quick Version

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community event, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and any future events <em>without a refund</em> (if applicable), or from the community itself, at the discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Event hosts and attendees, including sponsors, staff and volunteers, should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or community with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. All of our organisers' contact details are listed on our website.

Organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and contributions to the community.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all community events, whether professional, social or a mix of both.
