## Help improve developers in your community...

# ...by hosting a coderetreat in your city.
 
Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding a local sponsor,
running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration.


To host a coderetreat:

* Pick a date and time to hold your coderetreat. Coderetreats lasts for a day (9:00am-5:00pm). Because of this, coderetreats are usually held on a Saturday.
* Find a place to hold your coderetreat. Many local tech companies are willing to serve as a venue.
* Find one or more local sponsors for lunch and other expenses. Coderetreats must be free.
* Recruit a facilitator to guide the participants through the day.
* Arrange for a nice, catered lunch. Participants who are willing to come out at 9 in the morning to spend the day coding deserve more than just pizza for lunch.

Here are some additional blog posts about hosting:

* Alex Bolboaca has been organizing and facilitating an ongoing series of coderetreats in Romania. He wrote a great post on [organizing coderetreats](http://www.alexbolboaca.ro/wordpress/articles/how-to-organize-a-code-retreat).
* John Smith has a great post on the specifics of [what to think about when organizing a coderetreat](http://geekswithblogs.net/onefloridacoder/archive/2010/08/16/setting-up-for-the-orlando-code-retreat.aspx).
