{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Dhaka, Bangladesh","description":"Global Day of Coderetreat [1] is an international event for developers across the world. The purpose is to practice better coding without the pressure of \"getting things done\". This year, Hackers and Founders community is organizing Coderetreat for the first time in Bangladesh! We're hopeful to gather a whole pack of developers and have a fun day with coding. If you are interested, you will have to: • bring your laptop (we will provide power, wifi and food)  • stay for the whole day, code, socialize and have fun  This event will be sponsored by Toptal [2] but attendees will have to pay a very small registration fee (100 Tk). Registration Link is coming soon. Please RSVP here if you are interested.
