{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 (one day early) - Athens, GA, USA","description":"Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the code retreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. \n\nMore specifically,  individuals are are grouped into teams of two and each team “solves” a common problem, ‘The Game of Life’.  There are 6 sessions throughout the day and for each session the groups are reorganized and the code deleted.  After each session there are session reflections to help with the  internalization of lessons. \n\nSnacks and lunches will be provided and it is guaranteed to be something other than pizza.  Sorry pizza lovers :) \nThe $10 ticket will be refunded to you the day of the CodeRetreat after we're sure you attend. :)\n\nFor more information about CodeRetreats see http://archive.coderetreat.org/.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/athens-code-retreat-2015-global-day-of-code-retreat-one-day-early","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Jonathan Wallace"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Athens, GA","coordinates":{"latitude":33.9519347,"longitude":-83.357567}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-13T09:00:00-04:00","end":"2015-11-13T16:00:00-04:00"}}
