By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2015-cleveland","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Joel Byler"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Cleveland, OH","coordinates":{"latitude":41.49932,"longitude":-81.6943605}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-14T08:30:00-04:00","end":"2015-11-14T17:00:00-04:00"}}
