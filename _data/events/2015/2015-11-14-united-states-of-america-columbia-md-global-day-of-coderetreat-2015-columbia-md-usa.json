{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Columbia, MD, USA","description":"Maryland is hosting a Global Day of Cod Retreat \nRegister here: http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Code-Craftsmanship/events/225535757/ \nCode Retreat is a day long fun way to improve your software craftsmanship in one day intensive with hands on Test Driven Development like you really mean it. You'll experiment with writing software in ways you never have before. You'll learn something new from each new pair partner you work with.Code Retreat focuses on the fundamentals of software development and design. \nBy providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the Code Retreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. \nMore specifically, individuals are are grouped into teams of two and each team “solves” a common problem, ‘The Game of Life’. There are multiple short sessions throughout the day and for each session the groups are reorganized. After each session there are session reflections to help with the internalization of lessons. \nAnd breakfast and lunch and snacks are provided.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2015-columbia-maryland-usa","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Camille Bell"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Columbia, MD","coordinates":{"latitude":39.2037144,"longitude":-76.86104619999999}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-14T08:30:00-04:00","end":"2015-11-14T17:00:00-04:00"}}
