{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Taiyuan, China","description":"Global Day of CodeRetreat - Taiyuan China. \nIt will be hosted by Chai Feng from Odd-e. \n\n \n  Local Sponsor: 素业学府茶文化馆\n \n \n \n  感谢本地赞助商: 素业学府茶文化馆\n  \n 之前的沟通出现一些误解，原本以为同学介绍过来的这个场地会是免费的，而且在当天茶馆老板也没有提任何关于费用的事情。直到周四早上，茶馆老板联系我的时候，这才发现是按照人头收费的。不过呢，这一天的活动依然是免费，大家还是放心来参加吧，费用我们来承担！ \nRegister: http://yihuo.de/activities/152\n 立即报名: http://yihuo.de/activities/152 \nCoderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'Getting Things Done', the CodeRetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. \nMore specifically, individuals are are grouped into teams of two and each team “solves” a common problem, ‘The Game of Life’. There are 6 sessions throughout the day and for each session the groups are reorganized and the code deleted. After each session there are session reflections to help with the internalization of lessons. \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/Xuefu+Park+%EF%BC%88West+Gate%EF%BC%89/@37.8088583,112.5704235,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xd77fdc71e9f6c0aa \n素业学府茶文化馆：太原市学府街学府公园西门内 \n (http://res.yihuo.de/FlbJPolxU04frEJDlF8L0XWQ5E6P)","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-taiyuan-china","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Chai Feng"}],"location":{"country":"China","city":"Taiyuan","coordinates":{"latitude":37.87059,"longitude":112.548879}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-14T09:00:00+08:00","end":"2015-11-14T16:00:00+08:00"}}
