{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Timisoara, Romania","description":"A coderetreat is a full day event that aims to offer a safe haven for programming experiments. For a whole day, programmers gather to program, experiment, learn, and have fun. It is the ideal place for programmers to do the things they can not do at work. To try out crazy ideas, to improve themselves by interacting with others, to write code using test driven development, pair programming, and other agile practices. \nGlobal Day of Coderetreat represents a network of such events held in the same day all over the world. Not only programmers can interact with others from the same group, but they can have online chats and live video streams with others from different parts of the world. \nRomania was the first non-US country to host a code retreat, so we have a tradition and passion for this type of events. \nTimisoara hosted its first Coderetreat November 21st 2009 and since then we've participated to all Global Days of Coderetreat.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2014-timisoara-romania-1","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Radu Ticiu"}],"location":{"country":"Romania","city":"Timisoara","coordinates":{"latitude":45.7488716,"longitude":21.2086793}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-14T09:00:00+03:00","end":"2015-11-14T17:30:00+03:00"}}
