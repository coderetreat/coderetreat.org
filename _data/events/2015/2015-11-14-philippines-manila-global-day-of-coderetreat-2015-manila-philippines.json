{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Manila, Philippines","description":"Coderetreat is a day-long workshop focused on the fundamentals of software development and design, providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused exercises away from the daily routine of “writing usable code.” We will spend the day programming, pairing with different people and go home without a program. Unintuitive as it may sound at first, taking a step back from production realities can be quite liberating. The code retreat takes great advantage of the format to hammer home fundamental principles of good software.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2015-manila-philippines","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Edaine Joyce Paz"}],"location":{"country":"Philippines","city":"Manila","coordinates":{"latitude":14.5995124,"longitude":120.9842195}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-14T09:00:00+08:00","end":"2015-11-14T17:00:00+08:00"}}
