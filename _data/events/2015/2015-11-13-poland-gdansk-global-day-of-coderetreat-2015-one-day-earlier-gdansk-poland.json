{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 (one day earlier) - Gdańsk, Poland","description":"Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. \n \nWe scheduled four different session during which we will be practicing coding in: Java, Scala, Go, PHP, Python \nSession #1 \n \n no constraints, master the game \n \nSession #2 (choose as many constraints as you want) \n \n polymorphism rather thean boolean flags \n no loops \n no if statements \n functional style \n small methods (<5 lines, 1 line?) \n no language primitives \n TDD As If You Meant It \n \nSession #3 \n \n silence, no talks, just code \n \nSession #4 \n \n (try) not to use mouse","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2015-gda-sk-poland-one-day-early","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Rafał Roppel"}],"location":{"country":"Poland","city":"Gdańsk","coordinates":{"latitude":54.35202520000001,"longitude":18.6466384}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-13T13:30:00+02:00","end":"2015-11-13T18:00:00+02:00"}}
