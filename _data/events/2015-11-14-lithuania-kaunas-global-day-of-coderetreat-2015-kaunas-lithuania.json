{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Kaunas, Lithuania","description":"Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practising the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.\n\nParticipation is free, but we kindly ask you to register here as seats are limited. On the day of event please bring a laptop with your favourite programming environment installed including your favourite testing library. It does not matter which programming language you use, as long as you enjoy coding in it.\n\nTickets: http://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-day-of-coderetreat-2015-kaunas-tickets-19025342311","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-code-retreat-4","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Adomas Greicius"}],"location":{"country":"Lithuania","city":"Kaunas","coordinates":{"latitude":54.8985207,"longitude":23.9035965}},"date":{"start":"2015-11-14T09:00:00+03:00","end":"2015-11-14T16:00:00+03:00"}}
