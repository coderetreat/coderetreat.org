Open for all students of the department. \nFor more info seeÂ https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/uutiset/78758\n\nCan you provide a bit more info, please? \nDo we need to register somewhere? Or to announce somehow that we'll come? \nWill the event be organized in English? Unfortunately, I don't know Finnish :( \nI'll be in Helsinki for a while (I'm from Romania) so I'll come to this code retreat :)\nUnfortunately the participation will be restrected to the students of University of Helsinki. Language will be Finnish...\nWhat a bummer! I thought the event should be open to everyone who wants to attend... Well, anyway... thanks for your quick response and good luck with the code retreat :)","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2013-helsinki-finland","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Matti Luukkainen"}],"location":{"country":"Finland","city":"Helsinki","coordinates":{"latitude":60.16985569999999,"longitude":24.938379}},"date":{"start":"2013-12-14T11:00:00+03:00","end":"2013-12-14T19:00:00+03:00"}}
