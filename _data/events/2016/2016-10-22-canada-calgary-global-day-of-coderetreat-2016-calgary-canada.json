Can more detail be added?\nI have updated the event with the link to the meetup group that has more detailed info and registration link. Let me know if you would like me to add anything else. \n \nCheers, \nTony","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-calgary-canada","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Tony Trung Thanh Vo"}],"location":{"country":"CANADA","city":"CALGARY","coordinates":{"latitude":51.0486151,"longitude":-114.0708459}},"date":{"start":"2016-10-22T09:00:00-06:00","end":"2016-10-22T16:00:00-06:00"}}
