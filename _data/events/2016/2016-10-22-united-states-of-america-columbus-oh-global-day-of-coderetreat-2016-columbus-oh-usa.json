{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - Columbus, OH, USA","description":"\n  A Coderetreat is an intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of \"getting things done\", the code retreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement.\n  \n \n  The Global Day of Coderetreat is a specially yearly event where people from across the global all participate in a Coderetreat. This year’s event for Columbus will be hosted as part of \n  Columbus Code Camp (http://columbuscodecamp.com/) so sign up there if you'd like to attend.\n  \n \n  So what should you expect at a Coderetreat? You should expect to code. Individuals are grouped into teams of two or three and each team works toward a solution to a common problem, in this case \n  Conway’s Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Each session lasts about an hour and there are several sessions over the course of the day. At the end of each session, code is deleted, groups are shuffled, and there is a retrospective to reflect upon and share what was learned. \n ","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-columbus-oh-usa","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Guy Royse"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Columbus, OH","coordinates":{"latitude":39.9611755,"longitude":-82.99879419999999}},"date":{"start":"2016-10-22T09:00:00-04:00","end":"2016-10-22T16:00:00-04:00"}}
