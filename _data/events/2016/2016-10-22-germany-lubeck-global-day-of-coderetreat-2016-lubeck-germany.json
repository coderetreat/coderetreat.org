{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - Lübeck, Germany","description":"We will celebrate the Global Day of Code Retreat in Lübeck! \nDuring normal work we don´t have much time to work on our core skills as developer. Under time pressure we often use known technics or habits although we know that there are better ways. \nAs well as an artist we need to have a place where we can practice our skills and that´s what is a code retreat about. \nIn small sessions we work in pairs so solve a small given problem... the whole day. It´s not about being finished, it´s about learning, making errors, trying new ways and having a lot of fun. \nPlease bring a laptop with your favorite IDE with you so that we can start in time. Lunch, drinks and food is provided by Dräger as well as the cozy athmosphere in their innovation garage. \nAfterwards we can have some beers in a pub.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-l-beck-germany","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Florian Mösch"}],"location":{"country":"Germany","city":"Lübeck","coordinates":{"latitude":53.8654673,"longitude":10.6865593}},"date":{"start":"2016-10-22T08:00:00+02:00","end":"2016-10-22T17:00:00+02:00"}}
