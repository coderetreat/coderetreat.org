{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Austin, TX, USA","description":"Agile Velocity will be hosting a Coderetreat in Austin as others around the world do the same on the Global Day of Coderetreat (http://gdcr.coderetreat.org (http://gdcr.coderetreat.org/)) on Saturday, November 15, 2014. Come join us at the Agile Velocity offices from 8am-5pm for a day of practicing the craft of programming. \n  \nCoderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. You can find out more about Coderetreat at http://archive.coderetreat.org (http://archive.coderetreat.org/). \n  \nAll skill levels are welcome, and everyone will learn something new about programming. You will need a laptop (ready to use a programming language you are comfortable with) and a willingness to pair program with others and have fun. We will work together to explore a programming problem throughout the day in a series of 45 minutes sessions with discussions. \n\n Food and drink will be provided for both breakfast and lunch. If you will attend, please register at the Eventbrite link below to help us ensure we have food (and room) for everyone. \nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-day-of-coderetreat-tickets-14120818749","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2014-austin-tx-usa","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Eric Stewart"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Austin, TX","coordinates":{"latitude":30.267153,"longitude":-97.7430608}},"date":{"start":"2014-11-15T08:00:00-05:00","end":"2014-11-15T17:00:00-05:00"}}
