By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular design and clean code, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.  \nMore information about what it is you can find here: http://archive.coderetreat.org/about \nDon't forget to bring your own computer!
