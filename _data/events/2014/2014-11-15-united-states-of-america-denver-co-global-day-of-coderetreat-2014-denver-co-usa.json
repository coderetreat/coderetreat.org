{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Denver, CO, USA","description":"Pivotal Labs will be hosting a Denver instance of Code Retreat as others around the world do the same. We'll meet at 8am at Pivotal's office within Galvanize and spend the day practicing our craft of programming. \nPair programming, test-driven development, and conscious practice are the main themes of the day, which we will explore through the lens of a single programming problem in six 45 minute sessions. When a session is over, we'll talk about how we approached the problem: how our choices of language, paradigm, and vocabulary shaped the solution. We'll also think about how our approach to pairing affected the kind of solution that was developed. At the end of the hour, we'll delete our code, find a new pair, and explore the problem again. \nEveryone is welcome - beginner, intermediate, expert - and everyone will learn something new, likely something unexpected, about the craft of programming. You'll need only a few things: a laptop with your favorite development tools, an open mind, and a sense of humor for when we delete our code. \nFood and drink (coffee, tea, soda-pop, but no alcohol)Â will be provided for both breakfast and lunch. Once we're done, some might decide to socialize at a nearby pub. \nIf you will attend, please register - there's a link to Eventbrite below - to help us ensure there is enough food for everyone to be happy. \nSee you in November!","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2014-denver-co-usa","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Sean Duckett"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Denver, CO","coordinates":{"latitude":39.7392358,"longitude":-104.990251}},"date":{"start":"2014-11-15T09:00:00-06:00","end":"2014-11-15T16:00:00-06:00"}}
