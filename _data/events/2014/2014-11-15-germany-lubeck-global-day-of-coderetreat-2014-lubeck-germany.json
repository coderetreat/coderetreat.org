{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Lübeck, Germany","description":"We will celebrate the Global day of code retreat (http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) in Lübeck!\n \n During normal work we don´t have much time to work on our core skills as developer. Under time pressure we often use known technics or habits although we know that there are better ways.\n \n As well as an artist we need to have a place where we can practice our skills and that´s what is a code retreat about.\n \n In small sessions we work in pairs so solve a problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)... the whole day. It´s not about being finished, it´s about learning, making errors, trying new ways and having a lot of fun.\n \n Please bring a laptop with your favorite IDE with you so that we can start in time. Lunch and food is offered by Dräger (http://www.draeger.com/sites/de_de/Pages/Krankenhaus/Welcome.aspx). Afterwards we can have some beers in a pub.\n \n The agenda:\n \n 8:00 : Arrival and Breakfast\n 8:30 : Introduction\n 9:00 : Session #1\n 9:45 : Retro\n 10:00 : Session #2\n 10:45 : Retro\n 11:00 : Session #3\n 11:45 : Retro\n 12:00 : Lunch\n 13:30 : Session #4\n 14:15 : Retro\n 14:30 : Session #5\n 15:15 : Retrospektive und Pause\n 15:30 : Session #6\n 16:15 : Retro\n 16:30 : Complete Retro for the day\n 17:00 : End","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2014-l-beck-germany","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Thilko Richter"}],"location":{"country":"Germany","city":"Lübeck","coordinates":{"latitude":53.8654673,"longitude":10.6865593}},"date":{"start":"2014-11-15T08:00:00+02:00","end":"2014-11-15T17:00:00+02:00"}}
