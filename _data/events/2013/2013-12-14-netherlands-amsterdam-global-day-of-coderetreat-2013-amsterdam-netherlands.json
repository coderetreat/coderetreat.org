{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 - Amsterdam, Netherlands","description":"Zilverline (http://www.zilverline.com/) is hosting the Global Day Coderetreat 2013. \nOur maximum amount of participants is 20 people.  \nZilverline also sponsors: \n- free parking at Science Park (between buildings Matrix 400 and 402)\n- lunch, drinks and snacks\n\nWhen do you start and what’s the plan?\nThe plan: \nWalk-in at 8:30 \nIntroduction 9:00 \nFirst start coderetreat session 9:30 \nAfter two sessions we either do another one, or have a (free) lunch (group decision) \nWe have beer at 16:00 \nWe aim at 5, perhaps 6 (depends on energy) coderetreats. \n\nConway's Game of Life ? Last year we did Game of Life as well. This year the Code Retreat participants in Cambridge will have a go at it. I'll look up some (hopefully) fresh ideas in mathematical game literature (Smullyan, Allen Paulos etc.).\nYes, Conway's Game of life, it might be a bit repetative if you did many coderetreats before. However, you could also visit a legacy coderetreat session, which uses a different 'puzzle' ;) \nDebugging a legacy code implementing Game of Life? Sounds cool!\nYes, not this time though. \nYou should attend a \"Legacy Code Retreat\" for that. I'd recommend it ;-)\nThank you all, I really had fun today!\nYes, it was really fun. Thanks for coming all;  \nas promised, here some urls: \nLife in life: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8\nStephen Hawking about GoL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOcEZinQ2I \nThanks again, \nIf you want to know about more events, check my twitter feed @stefanhendriks and keep watching the Coderetreat events!\nAs promised I would let you send a link about the Legacy Coderetreat - http://legacycoderetreat.typepad.com/","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2013-amsterdam-netherlands","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Stefan Hendriks"}],"location":{"country":"Netherlands","city":"Amsterdam","coordinates":{"latitude":52.3702157,"longitude":4.895167900000001}},"date":{"start":"2013-12-14T09:00:00+02:00","end":"2013-12-14T18:00:00+02:00"}}
