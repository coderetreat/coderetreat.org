{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 - Des Moines, IA, USA","description":"Des Moines, IA is participating in the Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 (http://globalday.coderetreat.org/)! \nCoderetreat (http://archive.coderetreat.org/) is a day-long, intensive practice event focused on the fundamentals of software development and design.The unique coderetreat format (which eliminates the pressure of 'getting things done' and focuses on practicing basic principles of good design) has proven to be a highly effective (and fun) means of skill improvement.\n \n On December 14th, Coderetreats will be held at cities all over the world. To celebrate this significant event, we'll be participating in some global activities in addition to our normal Coderetreat activities. \nYou only need to bring a laptop with the development tools you require to write code using your chosen programming languages.  \nCheck out coderetreat.org (http://archive.coderetreat.org/) for further details on what to expect.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2013-des-moines-ia-usa","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Kevin Knowles"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Des Moines, IA","coordinates":{"latitude":41.6005448,"longitude":-93.6091064}},"date":{"start":"2013-12-14T09:00:00-05:00","end":"2013-12-14T16:00:00-05:00"}}
