{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 - Sydney, Australia","description":"Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. \nParticipate in the global coderetreat here in Sydney, NSW, Australia. \nBring a laptop with all the development tools you require to write code using your chosen programming languages. \nLunch will be provided. This event is free for everyone. \nOnce registered, refer to Corey Haines's coderetreat site (http://coderetreat.com/) for further details on what to expect or turn up and have a great day.\n\nI'll only be there for part of the day, as I've got another event that day. :(\nNo problems at all Andrew. Happy to have you for as long as we can get you :)\nWhat time does it start / finish? How much does it cost?\nHi Joshua, the event is all day (9-5) and it's free for everyone.\nHow do we access the office? Will there be someone downstairs to let us in? \nYep, there'll be a bunch of ThoughtWorks people around and we'll let everyone in/man the doors.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2013-sydney-australia","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"James Gregory"}],"location":{"country":"Australia","city":"Sydney","coordinates":{"latitude":-33.8688197,"longitude":151.2092955}},"date":{"start":"2013-12-14T09:00:00+11:00","end":"2013-12-14T16:00:00+11:00"}}
