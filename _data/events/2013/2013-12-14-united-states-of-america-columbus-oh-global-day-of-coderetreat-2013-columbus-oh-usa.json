{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 - Columbus, OH, USA","description":"Global Day of Code Retreat at The Forge in Columbus Complements of Pillar Technology.\n\nThank you Pillar Technology for hosting this event!\nIs there any cost? Â Should I bring anything other than a computer?\nFree! And, yes, bring a laptop.\nIs this an annual event? I'm from NE Ohio, looking for a potential Code Retreat to attend and from what I can tell this is the only regular event in Ohio.\nThe Global Day of Coderetreat is is an annual event. Pillar hosts it in Columbus every year. I think LeanDog does it in Cleveland. \nHowever, coderetreats can happen any time of the year. I know there is usually one as part of the Path to Agility conference in Columbus every year. And, you could always try and drum up some interest in one in your area.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2013-columbus-ohio","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Guy Royse"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Columbus, OH","coordinates":{"latitude":39.9611755,"longitude":-82.99879419999999}},"date":{"start":"2013-12-14T09:00:00-04:00","end":"2013-12-14T17:00:00-04:00"}}
