{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Detroit, MI, USA","description":"Join us for Detroit's twist on the Global Day of CodeRetreat complements of Pillar Technology. It will be taking place as part of the 1DevDay Conference and held within the newly remodeled Cobo Center. We'll have sessions running in conjunction with the conference and encourage folks to pop in and out as they feel comfortable, whether that be for the whole day or just for an hour or two. \nSpecial Note - This is part of the 1DevDay Conference and requires a ticket to that event in order to participate. Please register for that first here (http://1devday.net/#tile_registration) and then if you care to, come back and register on this page so we have an idea of who will join us for the actual retreat. \nThanks. \ndaniel.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-detroit-mi-1devday-conference","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"Daniel Davis"}],"location":{"country":"United States of America","city":"Detroit, MI","coordinates":{"latitude":42.331427,"longitude":-83.0457538}},"date":{"start":"2014-11-15T08:00:00-04:00","end":"2014-11-15T17:00:00-04:00"}}
