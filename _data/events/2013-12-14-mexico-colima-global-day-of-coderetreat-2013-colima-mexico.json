{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 - Colima, Mexico","description":"Colima will be participating in the Global Day of Coderetreat 2013!\n \n Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event focused on the fundamentals of software development and design.The unique coderetreat format (which eliminates the pressure of 'getting things done' and focuses on practicing basic principles of good design) has proven to be a highly effective (and fun) means of skill improvement.  Check out to Corey Haines's coderetreat site if you want further details on what to expect.\n \n On December 14th, Coderetreats will be held at cities all over the world. To celebrate this significant event, we'll be participating in some global activities in addition to our normal Coderetreat activities. Afterwards, stick around and we'll all go out to dinner or for a few drinks. It's going to be a lot of fun! \n\n  \n \n\n \n  You only need to bring a laptop with the development tools you require to write code using your chosen programming languages.  A continental breakfast and lunch will be provided.","url":"https://web.archive.org/http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-code-retreat-colima-2013","spoken_language":"","moderators":[{"name":"David Padilla"}],"location":{"country":"Mexico","city":"Colima","coordinates":{"latitude":19.1222634,"longitude":-104.0072348}},"date":{"start":"2013-12-14T09:00:00-05:00","end":"2013-12-14T19:00:00-05:00"}}
