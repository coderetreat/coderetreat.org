{"title":"Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Skopje, Macedonia","description":"We’re glad to be celebrating the Global Day of Coderetreat (http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) in Macedonia for the fifth time! \nPlease join us for an exciting day where not only we would practice OO software design by applying the 4 rules of simple design by Kent Beck but we would also have fun together, push ourselves to be better and learn from one another. \nCoderetreat is a one day event that provides developers the opportunity for skills improvement by focusing on software development and design fundamentals. By practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, participants can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. It aims to shrink the gap between the code we write under pressure of needing to deliver on time and the perfect code. \nThe agenda is as follows: \n- Solve the Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)\n - Pair programming\n - Each session lasts for 45 min\n - Small break of 15 min allowing time for retrospective\n - Change of pairs and new session \nSnacks and pizza will be provided by the host. \nPlease bring your personal laptop. \nSponsor: \n \n (http://www.endava.com/) \n \n===== \n \nNote: Registrations on this site are manually approved by admins (not organizer) to prevent spam.
