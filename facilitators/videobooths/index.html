      Join other events all over the world on Global Day of Coderetreat to make it a

          <p>On Global Day of Coderetreat, hundreds â€“ if not thousands! - of developers will participate in the same
            workshop all over the world. With our videobooths, you can connect with all the other events in a way that
            makes
            the event feel truly global!</p>
          <p>
            As a facilitator, all you need is a webcam and a projector that can point into the room throughout the
            sessions.
            Our videobooths will automatically select a room with other events, so you can keep it running without
            intervention throughout the sessions.
          </p>
          <p>If you'd like to take it a step further and say "hi" to other events, we suggest you join the
            <code>#coderetreat</code> or <code>#gdcr</code> channel on the <a
              href="https://slack.softwarecrafters.org">Software Crafters Slack</a></code> and reach out, as an actual
            call
            usually needs more preparations and scheduling.
          </p>

            <b>Ask your participants for consent!</b>
            Not everyone consents to their
            picture being broadcasted to the world. We recommend you let people <b>opt-in</b>
            to being on camera by pointing the camera at only a portion of
            the room.
