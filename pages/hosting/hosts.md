Help improve developers in your community by hosting a coderetreat in your city.

Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding a local sponsor, running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration.

To host a coderetreat:

* Pick a date and time to hold your coderetreat. Coderetreats lasts for a day (9:00am-5:00pm). Because of this, coderetreats are usually held on a Saturday.
* Find a place to hold your coderetreat. Many local tech companies are willing to serve as a venue.
* Find one or more local sponsors for lunch and other expenses. Coderetreats must be free.
* Recruit a facilitator to guide the participants through the day.
* Arrange for a nice, catered lunch. Participants who are willing to come out at 9 in the morning to spend the day coding deserve more than just pizza for lunch.
* Check the checklist for keeping track of things.
