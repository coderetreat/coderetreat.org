## Help improve developers in your community...

# ...by hosting a coderetreat in your city.

Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding a local sponsor,
running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration.


To host a coderetreat:

* Pick a date and time to hold your coderetreat. Coderetreats lasts for a day (9:00am-5:00pm). Because of this, coderetreats are usually held on a Saturday.
* Find a place to hold your coderetreat. Many local tech companies are willing to serve as a venue.
* Find one or more local sponsors for lunch and other expenses. Coderetreats must be free.
* Recruit a facilitator to guide the participants through the day.
* Arrange for a nice, catered lunch. Participants who are willing to come out at 9 in the morning to spend the day coding deserve more than just pizza for lunch.
* Check the [checklist](/pages/hosting/checklist) for keeping track of things.

Here are some additional blog posts about hosting:

* Alex Bolboaca has been organizing and facilitating an ongoing series of coderetreats in Romania. He wrote a great post on [organizing coderetreats](http://www.alexbolboaca.ro/wordpress/articles/how-to-organize-a-code-retreat).
* John Smith has a great post on the specifics of [what to think about when organizing a coderetreat](http://geekswithblogs.net/onefloridacoder/archive/2010/08/16/setting-up-for-the-orlando-code-retreat.aspx).

# ...by facilitating a coderetreat in your city.

Facilitators guide participants through the exercises and lead the
retrospectives. Below are the steps to get started:
1. If possible, [attend at least one coderetreat](/events) before attempting to facilitate a coderetreat yourself
2. Watch [this recorded facilitator training session](https://vimeo.com/54519386) to learn the basics
3. Read about [the role of the facilitator](/blog/2011/12/02/on-the-role-of-the-coderetreat-facilitator)
4. Become familiar with [the structure of a coderetreat](/pages/facilitating/structure-of-a-coderetreat)
5. Get ideas on what exercises to do each session by reviewing the [activity catalog](/pages/facilitating/activity-catalog) or checkout [this exhaustive collection of constraints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3idvASFqaEbN2RkNDYyYjktYTlkZi00ZjFiLWFmMDEtNjJhYTBkYzM2ZDlh?usp=sharing) by [Adrian Bolboaca](https://twitter.com/adibolb)
