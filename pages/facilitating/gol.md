Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is
determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One
interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional 
orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible
 states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, 
which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or 
diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions 
occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first 
generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to 
every cell in the seed?births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the 
discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in 
other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before). The 
rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
