        <p>With COVID-19 having a severe impact on the availability of on-site events, we're embracing the virtual
            events we had in the past more than ever. We encourage you to stay safe. If an on-site event
            isn't for you, we hope you'll find a remote event that matches your timezone.</p>
        <p>If you're considering organizing your own event, we're here to support you on the journey of
                organizing your first coderetreat. Head over to the <a
